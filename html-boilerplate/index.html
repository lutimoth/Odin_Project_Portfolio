            Just a simple test of html.
            This is the first paragraph I will be writing.
        </p>
<!-- Second paragraph comments! -->
        <p>
            This is the second paragraph which has the p tag for paragraphs! 
            Super useful and super easy to understand.

            If I want to bold, I use strong like <strong>this!</strong>
            If I want italics, to emphasize, I make it look like <em> this!</em>
